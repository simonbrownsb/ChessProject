# Notes

I'm tracking my thought-process here, to capture all of the "conversations" that would have
taken place with other people if this had been a real project.

I'm doing the Java version of the project.


## Initial Thoughts

  - I've read through the source and test code, and have attempted to run the existing tests
    to see what happens.

  - I can immediately see various refactorings and restructurings that I would like to do, but
    the very first priority is to get the existing tests passing (partly because that is the
    scope of this sprint! - and partly because I will feel a whole lot happier about changing
    things subsequently if I've got a working test suite to give me confidence).

  - I'll need to make various decisions about things. In a real project, we'd be having
    conversations, some pair-programming, code-reviews, etc. In lieu of all that, I'll just
    capture them here in this NOTES file.

  - I'm going to consider these classes as **NOT** being a fixed externally-specified API. So I'm
    going to feel free to change that API, and the semantics exposed through it, if I feel it's
    justified.

  - The very first thing I'm going to is definitely going to change that API, but I think it's
    something so crucially wrong (conceptually) in the existing code, that it needs to be tackled
    first. And that's that the board width and height are given as constants with the value **7**.
    That's confusing the *number of squares* abstraction with the low-level internal *indexing*
    abstraction (there are 8 squares, indexed from 0 to 7 in Java). So the first thing I'll do will
    be to change those numbers from 7 to 8. I know the board is supposed to be an 8x8 one, as
    that's how it looks in the supporting "specification" (from http://www.chessvariants.org/d.chess/),
    though I guess it's open to being able to support different configurations in the future.

## First Task - Getting the existing tests passing

  - I'm running the tests with **mvn test**, and they're starting off with 14 tests and
    12 failures. They're all *UnsupportedOperationException* errors, because the problem is
    that the method implementations are currently just stubs.

  - I'll change the *MAX_BOARD_WIDTH* and *MAX_BOARD_HEIGHT* constants in *ChessBoard.java*
    from 7 to 8. That'll actually break two of the existing tests so I'll be starting off in
    what will look like the wrong direction (increasing the number of failing tests), but I'll
    immediately change that test to match. This is an API change, of course, not just an
    internal implementation detail. But I'm happy with that.

  - I now get 2 additional failures. But I'll immediately fix that by changing the two tests
    in *ChessBoardTest.java* that check the board size (to check for 8, rather than 7).

  - Now I'll start implementing the internals of the methods that are currently just stubs.
    I'll start with *ChessBoard.IsLegalBoardPosition*, which I'll implement in the simplest
    possible way, just checking that both the *x* and *y* coordinates are in range (and just
    doing that in the simplest way, not using anything complicated). But I'll split the logic
    into separate cases for the *x* and *y* coordinates, so as to avoid having a potentially
    hard-to-read complicated boolean expression with lots of terms in it. Now I get 1 failure
    and 6 errors from my 14 tests.

  - It feels odd to get a failure, so next, I'll read through all the tests in some detail and
    check that they are all make sense. On my initial quick scan, I saw at least one that looked a
    bit dodgy! Ah yes, the test that [11, 5] is not a legal board position appears to have a small
    typo that it is expecting it to be *true* rather than *false*. This is what was causing that
    one failure above, So I'll change that. Now I get 0 failures and 6 UnsupportOperationException
    errors.

  - Looking through the tests, the logic in *ChessBoardTest.testLimits_The_Number_Of_Pawns*
    feels a bit strange, but I'll come back to that later.

  - Now I'll implement the *ChessBoard.Add* method. I'll initially do this in the very simplest
    way I can (by just inserting the pawn into *pieces* 2-d array). From reading the other tests,
    and the *Pawn.java* code, I see that it is expected to set colour and the X and Y coordinates,
    as properties of the pawn object itself too (and to set coordinates to -1 if not valid).
    I'm not sure I'm very happy with those semantics, but for now, I'll just do it that way. So
    now it's implementation does the following:

      - check (using *IsLegalBoardPosition*) the coordinates are in range, and reset them to -1 if not.
      - set the chessBoard property on the pawn
      - set the piece colour on the pawn
      - set the X coordinate on the pawn
      - set the Y coordinate on the pawn
      - assign the pawn to the appropriate slot in the *pieces* property.

    In setting the piece colour, I see that the *Pawn.setPieceColor* method is private, unlike
    all the rest of them which are public. There's no reason for it to be private, and it means
    I can't call it from the *ChessBoard* class, so I'll change that to public. (I'm actually
    a bit unhappy with the idea that a pawn can change its colour; it feels like it would be
    much better for that to be an unmutable property of the object, just set as final when it
    ia constructed, but I'll leave that to a refactoring stage, since my initial priority is to
    change as little as possible until I've got a full set of tests running).

    Now I get 1 failure and 3 errors, from my 14 tests.

  - The one failure I'm getting is from that *testLimits_The_Number_Of_Pawns* test that I was
    concerned about earlier. So I'll look at that in more detail now.

    First thing I can see is that when it's placing pawns, it's using *MAX_BOARD_WIDTH* to
    control the Y coordinate. But that's wrong, since the Y coordinate is height. So I'll change
    that to *MAX_BOARD_HEIGHT*. It's a conceptual error, not one that would be picked up from
    the existing tests (since, for now, both the width and the height have the same value - but
    maybe they won't in the future, which is presumably why there are two separate constants
    rather than just a single "board size" value).

  - But that (of course) doesn't fix the failing test. Looking at the test in more detail, it's
    trying to place 10 black pawns. Then it's expecting the first 8 to be ok, and the remaining
    2 to be invalid (with coordinates of -1).  So I think that means that the *Add()* method needs
    to have an extra check to impose a limit on the number of pawns allowed for each colour.

    So I'll do that. For now I'll do it really explicitly inside the *ChessBoard* class, as a check
    in its *Add()* method. Eventually we'll need to handle different types of pieces, and this
    limit on pawns is very specific to it being a pawn, but I won't try (yet) to abstract this into
    the *Pawn* class itself.

    An alternative thing that the test might be trying to do (though I don't think so, because
    of its name, and because its using Black pawns) is to test that White isn't allowed to have any
    pawns on "row 0". The movement rules (and initial-placement rules) should prohibit that.
    That would be a good thing to test too, but I think I'll add that later as an additional test,
    once I've got this initial set all passing.

  - Now I get 3 errors from my 14 tests, all because of the unimplemented *Move()* method  in the
    *Pawn* class. According to the spec in thw README file, pawns can only move forward one space
    (in the same column). But the diagram shows that a pawn can also move forward two spaces (which,
    after a quick google to check, is allowed if the pawn is still in its "start position" column).
    I think I'll use the diagram to guide me (though in real life this would have sparked off a
    conversation about the requirements), so I'll include that "start position" case in the logic,
    even though that's arguably out-of-scope for this first sprint.

  - I'll implement *Pawn.Move()* in the simplest way I can think of, where all it needs to do is:

      - do nothing (for now) if it's a CAPTURE move rather than a MOVE one.
      - check that the pawn is moving forward by exactly one square (or possibly two squares if
        its on its "starter" column), taking account of the colour to determine direction of movement.
      - check (via a call to the *IsLegalBoardPosition()* method on the associated board object)
        that the new coordinates are allowed (and leave the pawn unmoved if not).
      - Update the board object so that it knows the pawn is in the new position (and is no
        longer in the old position).
      - Assign the new coordinates in the pawn object

    I'm not super-happy that the current representation means coordinates are being stored
    separately in two different places (in the board object, and also within each pawn object),
    as that introduces risk that some bug might get them out of sync. But I won't worry about
    that just now; I'm just trying to get the tests to pass right now!

  - Oh look! The *Pawn.getChessBoard* method isn't actually called that at all. It's mis-spelled
    as *getChesssBoard* (three S's). I'll fix that. Looks like an extra test would have detected
    that. I probably need to add some additional tests for a whole lot of stuff, including that,
    which I'll do as soon as I've finished this initial task.

  - Now all 14 tests are passing.


## Cleaning things up

  - Now all the tests are passing, and I've got a clearer idea of how the code is intending to
    work, I'll address some of the things that are making things unclear or hard to understand,
    in both the code and the tests.

  - I'll start by adding comments. No need to comment absolutely every obvious thing, but there
    are some non-obvious things going on that would be clearer with a few comments. So I'll do that
    (including some block javadoc comments for the big "API" things).

  - And I'll fix other issues I come across while doing so (and I'll try to write new tests for
    anything I find that's wrong, since clearly the existing tests aren't detecting them):

      - My logic for checking that it's ok to add a pawn at a particular position wasn't taking
        into account that you shouldn't be allowed to add a pawn on a square that already has a
        piece on it. So I'll fix that, and add an additional test. Actually, it turns out there
        was a test for this, so I don't need to add one. The test was there but it wasn't running,
        because the *ChessBoardTest* class was running under old-style JUnit 3 rules (because it was
        explicitly extending *junit.framework.TestCase*). Fixed that, so now there are 15 passing
        tests.

      - My logic for imposing a limit on the number of pawns you're allowed to add wasn't
        quite right (in that it wasn't taking account of the colour of the pawn). I'll fix that,
        and add an additional test, no now there are 16 passing tests.

      - One of the existing tests was written in what-C-people-call "Berkeley brace style" rather
        than what-C-people-call "K&amp;R brace style". So I'll change that to match the rest of
        the code.

  - It's not usual to write lots of specific tests to check that getters and setters are working
    correctly, so I won't do that. There had been a problem with misspelling of *Pawn.getChessBoard()*
    but I've fixed that, and I've checked the rest are ok by looking at them carefuly.

  - The *Pawn* class provides its own *toString()* method, but there is no test for this, so
    I'll add one. And just as well I did, since it turns out it was using *String.format()*
    incorrectly. Fixed that by using *java.text.MessageFormat* instead, and now there are 17
    passing tests.

  - I'm concerned about the risk of having piece coordinates being stored separately in two
    different places (in the pawn object, and also in the board object). I'm tempted to refactor
    this so that this info is stored **only** in the board, and make it so that if a piece needs to
    find out where it's currently placed, it should ask the board. But maybe there is a good reason
    for piece to be able to **efficiently** find out its location (like maybe this chess program
    is going to be used for exploring hundreds of millions of possible advance moves, and needs
    to be super-fast)? In real life, this would spark off a conversation and maybe some questions
    back to the business about use cases.

    For now, I'll mitigate the risk a bit by at least adding an extra test to check that if a
    piece moves itself, then the board state is correctly updated and in-sync. And... it's very
    good (and a bit embarassing) that I did this, as it's highlighted a bug in the *ChangePosition*
    method I'd added. If only there'd been a bit of pair-programming or code-review! But it also
    highlights that it **is** risky to have the representation in two places.

    To implement that test, I've added a new public method on the *ChessBoard* class, to fetch
    the piece at a particular (x, y) coordinate pair. I'm happy for this to be a public method,
    as I'm anticipating that this will be needed later anyway, outside of the tests.

    So now I have 18 passing tests.

  - I'm also going to change the names of variables in the tests where it refers to "row" and
    "column", renaming these to "rowIndex" and "columnIndex" instead. The terminology is a bit
    confusing, but it's important to be clear that by "rowIndex" we mean a particular square on
    a given row (we're not referring to "which row it is", we're referring to "where on that row
    it is"). Maybe we should always just use "x" and "y", as that's clearer? Actually yes, that's
    even better, so I'll do that (in the tests). Done that, and still have 18 passing tests.


## Refactoring

  - Anticipating that we're going to want to have more piece types than just pawns (though not
    for this sprint), it feels like it's a good idea to, as early as possible, start to prepare
    for that. I'll introduce an abstract base class called *Piece*, which will provide all of
    the functionality that will be common across all pieces (with abstract methods for the
    details of how to do things that are specific to particular piece types, i.e. initially pawns).
    I won't change any of the API, so all of the existing tests should still all work unchanged.

  - The design for the way the colour of a piece is managed seems a bit poor. You have to specify
    the piece colour when you construct the piece object - but then you always have to respecify
    that when you add the piece to a board. That seems wrong - and it is also the only thing that
    is preventing all of the Piece classes from being "bean-like" (i.e. having a zero-args
    constructor, and gettings/setters for all fields). If we're going to be persisting these things
    anywhere, it'll make things a lot simpler if they're "bean-like". Also, it's just more
    consistent and symmetric (given that none of the other property fields are set in the
    constructor, even ones, like the board property, that feel like they're mandatory). So I'll
    remove that parameter from the constructor. The colour is always being set explicitly afterwards
    anyway so having it there adds no value.

    I'll also add an additional check to make sure a piece on one board isn't accidentally added
    to a different board (and add a test for this, which fails until I've made that change).

    Now now that's 19 passing tests.

  - I'm not so happy about the name format conventions we're using for names of methods. Maybe it's
    "house style", so it's ok. But it's a bit of a mixture between standard "camelcase with initial
    lowercase letter" and "camelcase with initial uppercase letter". The first is the usual standard
    for Java, so I'll refactor the (small number of) methods that aren't following that, to make
    them do so. That's basically just *ChessBoard.Add()* and *Piece.Move()*, I think.
    Oh, and *Piece.CurrentPositionAsString()* (though I'm not really sure when that exists as
    a separate method, rather than just being embedded directly inside *toString()*).

  - We'll tighten up the protection on *Piece.currentPositionAsString()* too. It's currently
    *protected*, but there doesn't seem any purpose to that. It's usually best for protections to be
    as tight as possible, so I'll tighten that up as *private*. If it turns out to need to be
    more open than that, we can always revert it later.


## Additional thoughts

  - The current semantics for invalid requests (like calling *ChessBoard.Add()* incorrectly,
    or *Piece.Move()* incorrectly isn't very nice. The first just silently sets the coordinates
    of the piece to "special magic values" of -1, and the second just silently does nothing.

    It'd be much better if these exceptional cases raised exceptions. There's nothing mentioned
    in the README spec about these special magic values.

    I've thought about adding two new custom exception classes: *InvalidPositionException* and
    *InvalidMoveException*, making *ChessBoard.Add()* and *Piece.Move()* throw these exceptions
    on errors, and adjusting the existing tests to take account of this. But that feels like a
    bigger change so I'm recording it as something to consider, but won't do it just now. Testing
    for exceptions being raised would be much easier if we could use JUnit 5 (and Java 8 or higher),
    so maybe need to discuss requirements on dependencies on those too.
